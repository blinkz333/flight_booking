# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

First I've some problem about bpk ,  My Vscode display some error so I choose reactstrap for use some Component (Button , Card) , react-icons to use Arrow icon 

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?
I'm not sure about this question. always use npm start
(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
If I have time , I will add some search by date , user can select departure -> arrival , select 2 agent compare , sort by (ex: sort by price )  make ux better , now I sort data by Rating with agent 

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I proud about I write Css with myself because now in my company we have UI designer to make Css code for frontend same like I talk with you , since I work at frontend role I don't have a much time to write Css with myself , I think my Css might have some errors but I will improve myself better than now.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I spent the most time with Css as described in second question.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
Since I have tested in many companies I have never met. A company that describes the test so well. This is first time to happy when make a test LOL . 

In Json I don't sure some array are wrong like legs key index 4 

"departure_time": "2020-11-11T11:25",
"arrival_time": "2020-11-11T19:10",

durations_mins may be 465 ? 

PS. Maybe my English isn't that good. But I will always try to improve myself.
